### Problem

Bring up 3D Scanning platform for real time motion capture. Using a Single Shot 3D method developed by Dr. Florian Willomitzer [Single-shot 3d motion picture camera with a dense point cloud by Willomitzer and HÃ¤usler](https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-25-19-23451)

### Requirements
* Real-time processing of images from the aforementioned cameras (or offline sources),
* Generation of a dense, colorized point cloud
* Real-time rendering of generated point cloud 

### Tools
* C++
* PCL
* Eigen
* GreyPoint Cameras
* Projector

### Work
* Collaborated with CPL team
* Brought up original Project / Camera Platform / Harness from Germany for real time processing
* Brought up new PointGrey Camera
* Render 3D uncalibrated point cloud in real time with 2 Camera setup

### Results
* [Github](https://github.com/vnmr/orthrus)
* [Video](3Dscanning.mov)

### Next Steps
* Transition development plafform to high performance machine to reduce processing lag and latency
* Calibrate Cameras
