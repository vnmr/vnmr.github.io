### Problem

Bring up 3D Scanning platform for real time motion capture. Using a Single Shot 3D method developed by Dr. Florian Willomitzer [Single-shot 3d motion picture camera with a dense point cloud by Willomitzer and Häusler](https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-25-19-23451)

### Background

The single-shot 3D movie camera – 3D videos of fast scenes with unprecedented data quality. The information theoretical efficiency of triangulation (‘structured light’) systems is limited by the ‘ambiguity problem’. 

The concept of the ‘single shot 3D movie camera’ solves the ambiguity problem without relying on spatial or temporal codification of the projected signals. This enables the single-shot acquisition of 3D data with unprecedented resolution. 

The sensor delivers 300,000 independent 3D points with high resolution from each 1 Mpix camera frame. A 3D sensor with these features allows for a continuous 3D measurement of fast moving or deforming objects, resulting in a continuous 3D movie. 

Like a hologram, each movie-frame encompasses the full 3D information about the object surface, and the observation perspective can be varied while watching the 3D movie (see related videos).

This work extends Prof. Florian Willomitzters Thesis *“Single Shot 3D Sensing Close to Physical Limits”* by researching 3D physical, information, and computational limits of single-shot 3D sensing


### Requirements
