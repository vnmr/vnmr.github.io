The MAP-Elites algorithm can efficiently explore reinforcement learning problems and optimize collections of solutions over user-defined ranges of possible behaviors. However, MAP-Elites can be difficult to scale to highly dimensional problem spaces, such as the optimization of large deep neural networks. Traditional deep reinforcement can train agents with complex network model byrelying on human-designed extrinsic rewards. In complex problems, this translates into reward landscapes that are extremely sparseand hard to explore. This has inspired the development of curiosity-driven reinforcement learning algorithms that make use of intrinsic rewards to continuously optimize for novel policies. While this approach encourage exploration, it remains to be seen whether they can be used similarly to MAP-Elites to search for a collection of highly diverse solutions.

**Contribution** First benchmark comparison of Exploration in RL with MAP-Elites+Evolutionary Algorithms.

3D measurement of complicated surfaces with a tablet.  The introduced system allows for the three-dimensional measurement of extended specular surfaces with high surface normal variations. It consists only of a mobile handheld device (such as a Tablet) and exploits screen and front camera for Deflectometry-based surface measurements. High quality surface measurements are possible without the need for an offline calibration procedure. To compensate for the small screen of a mobile device a multi-view registration technique is applied so that large surfaces can be densely reconstructed in their entirety.  The mobile Deflectometry project is a first step towards a self-calibrating measurement procedure capable of taking 3D surface measurements in the wild and accessible to users with little to no technical imaging experience.  We developed a ‘surface measurement app’ that received an overwhelming amount of media coverage.

A novel camera system that employs a natural Human Computer Interface.
An operator controls a wrist mounted camera with finger gestures. 
The camera gestures are detected, classified, and acted upon in real time.
The system is comprised of an embedded computer, inertial and force sensors
haptic, audio, and visual feedback components on a wearable substrate. 
Signals from sensors are processed and classified with classical signal and machine
learning techniques.

### Single-shot 3D movie camera at the limit

<img src="3dface.png" alt="3D Face" width="300"/>

The single-shot 3D movie camera – 3D videos of fast scenes with unprecedented 
data quality. The information theoretical efficiency of triangulation 
(‘structured light’) systems is limited by the ‘ambiguity problem’. The 
concept of the ‘single shot 3D movie camera’ solves the ambiguity problem 
without relying on spatial or temporal codification of the projected signals.
This enables the single-shot acquisition of 3D data with unprecedented 
resolution. The sensor delivers 300,000 independent 3D points with high 
resolution from each 1 Mpix camera frame. A 3D sensor with these features 
allows for a continuous 3D measurement of fast moving or deforming objects, 
resulting in a continuous 3D movie. Like a hologram, each movie-frame 
encompasses the full 3D information about the object surface, and the observation
perspective can be varied while watching the 3D movie (see related videos).

This work extends Prof. Florian Willomitzters Thesis *"Single Shot 3D 
Sensing Close to Physical Limits"* by researching 3D physical, information, 
and computational limits of single-shot 3D sensing
