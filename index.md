### Problem

#### Create an end to end processing pipeline and platform for 3D measurement experimentation. The first application is for Phase Measuring Deflectometry experiments. This application allows to perform a 3D reconstuction of a surface with 2D image data.

### Requirements

####
* Software Server for image processing, integrate Computational Photography Labs PMD algorithms into pipeline
* Software Client for live preview and image capture
* Software Client to view and manipulate reconstruction 3D scenes
* Must run on consumer mobile devices
* Must be robust to network conditions
* Improve processing performance

### Tools

####
* Python
* Qt
* Objective-C
* Consumer devices - iPhone, iPad, Mac

### Work
* Collaborated with CPL team
* Re-architected and Re-designed 3D reconstruction experiment platform from scratch.
* Ensured stable, performant ad-hoc peer to peer pipeline and platform for image acquisition, processing, viewing.
* Integrated and debugged CPL code
* Reduced processing time, data capture size by 5x
* Prepared Demonstration
