We propose a new deep learning architecture that introduces a deep channel filter 
and skeleton joint related constraints as losses to a previous 2-stage temporal 
deep CNN network to reduce joint position and motion errors for 3D 
video human body pose estimation. Our model outperforms the previous reported best 
result from the literature based on mean per-joint position error on the Human 3.6M 
benchmark by 1\% This corresponds to a new state-of-the-art error reduction in all
categories, opening opportunites to combine these methods with future 3D human pose 
 estimators.
