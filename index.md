## 3D Human Pose Detection
We propose a new deep learning architecture that introduces a deep channel filter 
and skeleton joint related constraints as losses to a previous 2-stage temporal 
deep CNN network to reduce joint position and motion errors for 3D 
video human body pose estimation. Our model outperforms the previous reported best 
result from the literature based on mean per-joint position error on the Human 3.6M 
benchmark by 1\% This corresponds to a new state-of-the-art error reduction in all
categories, opening opportunites to combine these methods with future 3D human pose 
 estimators.

## Deflectometry
3D measurement of complicated surfaces with a tablet.
The introduced system allows for the three-dimensional measurement of extended 
specular surfaces with high surface normal variations. It consists only of a 
mobile handheld device (such as a Tablet) and exploits screen and front camera
for Deflectometry-based surface measurements. High quality surface measurements
are possible without the need for an offline calibration procedure. To compensate
for the small screen of a mobile device a multi-view registration technique is 
applied so that large surfaces can be densely reconstructed in their entirety. 
The mobile Deflectometry project is a first step towards a self-calibrating 
measurement procedure capable of taking 3D surface measurements in the wild 
and accessible to users with little to no technical imaging experience. 
We developed a ‘surface measurement app’ that received an overwhelming amount of
media coverage.
