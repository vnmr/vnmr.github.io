Requirements
- Software Server for image processing, integrate Computational Photography Labs PMD algorithms into pipeline
- Software Client for live preview and image capture
- Software Client to view and manipulate reconstruction 3D scenes
- Must run on consumer mobile devices
- Must be robust to network conditions
- Improve processing performance


Tools
- Python
- Qt
- Objective-C
- Consumer mobile devices - iPhone, iPad

Work
- Collaborated with CPL team
- Re-architected and Re-designed 3D reconstruction experiment platform from scratch.
- Ensure Stable, performant ad-hoc peer to peer pipeline and platform for image acquisition, processing, viewing.
- Integrated and debugged CPL code
- Reduced processing time, data capture size by 5x
- Prepared Demonstration
